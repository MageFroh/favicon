This plugin is largely based on the `favicon_badge` plugin wirtten by ZeGuigui: see [this forum post](http://tt-rss.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=1373).
The fork has been created to solve a few issues (unread count not being reset, and transparent background in particular).

`Favicon.js` has originally been written by Michael Mahemoff: see [http://ajaxify.com/run/favicon], released under the MIT license.
